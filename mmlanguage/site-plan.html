      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The offer of remote work in Brazil has increased a lot, but the main requirement in most opportunities is to speak fluent English. 
        Have you ever thought that you can't have the job of your dreams because you don't speak the language? So I can help... 
        I connect professionals with the best teachers to learn, develop, practice and be able to take advantage of the best 
        professional opportunities available today. I do this considering the need and availability in a personalized and 
        individualized way.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The expected audience is technology professionals who intend to work remotely in American companies and need to improve their level of English.
        As they are people who already work remotely or could do it in their current job, they generally also seek a course that they can take from wherever they are.
        They can be programmers, project managers, software engineers, web designers, test engineers, data analysts, data scientists, system architects, 
        support analysts, scrum masters and other technical and non-technical professionals.
